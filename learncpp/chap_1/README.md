A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action.

A function is a collection of statements. Every C++ program must have a `main` function.

Comments can be:

```cpp
// Comment
/* Or this */
```

A data type tells the compiler how to interpret a piece of data into a meaningful value. For example integer.

Copy assignment (=) can be used to assign an already created variable.
